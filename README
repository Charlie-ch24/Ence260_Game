HOW TO INSTALL:
    Compile and make the source files on both UCFunKits with the bash command 'make program'.
    Both displays should now display the word "BOMBER".

HOW TO PLAY:
    The game has three phases - the bombing phase, the defusing phase, and the scoring phase.
    In the bombing phase, each player has nine bombs, which are hidden in the 'grid' (represented by the LED matrix). Both players share the same grid.
    In the defusing phase, find and defuse as many of the other player's bombs within 12 rounds. You can't see where your bombs were placed, so be careful!
    The player with the most surviving bombs wins.

MOVEMENT:
    Move the navswitch to move the player cursor, which is shown as a light on the LED matrix.
    Press the navswitch to place a bomb during the bombing phase, or defuse a bomb during the defusing phase.

GAMEPLAY:
    Both displays show 'BOMBER'.
    The player who presses the navswitch first is designated as player 1.

    BOMBING: Place your nine bombs. When your ninth bomb is placed, your blue light will flash to show that you are ready.
    Wait until both players are ready. You cannot place your bomb in the same place twice.

    DEFUSING: Each player has 12 turns to remove as many of their opponent's bombs as possible, with turns happening alternately. Player 1 starts.
    If a player's bomb has been hit (including their own), their blue LED will light up.
    
    SCORING: When the game end, press the navswitch to show the score. The player with the most surviving bombs has the higher score, and wins!
    Press the navswitch again to restart.
